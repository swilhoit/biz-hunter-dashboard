-- Database Restoration Script
-- This script will restore all tables and migrations in the correct order

-- First, let's check what we already have
SELECT 'Current tables:' as status;
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Now apply migrations in chronological order based on the filenames
-- Note: Some migrations might fail if they're already partially applied, that's ok
