## 🔧 Configuration

### Scraping Settings
```typescript
const config = {
  maxPages: 2,              // Pages to scrape per source
  delayBetweenRequests: 3000, // Rate limiting (ms)
  headless: true,           // Browser mode
  timeout: 30000,           // Page timeout (ms)
};
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Enhanced business_listings table
source TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Scraper source
image_url TEXT,                 -- Listing images
original_url TEXT,              -- Link to original listing
-- ... existing fields
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Rate Limiting & Ethics**
- Built-in delays respect website policies
- Configurable rate limiting per scraper
- Proper user agent identification
- Manual robots.txt compliance recommended

### **Data Quality**
- Each scraper has custom data validation
- Duplicate detection across sources
- Price and revenue normalization
- Industry categorization consistency

### **Performance**
- Scrapers run in parallel when possible
- Database operations optimized for bulk inserts
- Browser instances properly managed
- Memory usage monitored

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Scraper API Not Running**
   ```bash
   # Start the API server
   npm run scraping-api:dev
   ```

2. **CORS Errors**
   - API server includes CORS headers
   - Check that API is running on port 3001

3. **Selector Not Found**
   - Website structure may have changed
   - Update selectors in individual scraper files
   - Use `headless: false` for debugging

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Increase `delayBetweenRequests` in config
   - Some sites may require longer delays

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with visible browser for debugging
node run-scraper.js --debug scraperName
```

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Production Setup**: Replace mock API with real scraper integration
2. **Scheduling**: Add cron jobs for automated scraping
3. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and alerting
4. **Scaling**: Add queue system for high-volume scraping
5. **Analytics**: Track scraping performance and success rates
