# Deal Edit Modal Fix

## Problem
The edit deal button in the deal details page was not working - clicking it did nothing.

## Investigation
1. The button click handler was correctly toggling the `isEditing` state
2. The DealEditModal component was being rendered conditionally based on `isEditing`
3. The modal had complex form inputs that might have been causing issues

## Solution
Created a simplified version of the edit modal (`SimpleDealEditModal`) that:
- Uses basic HTML form elements instead of custom form components
- Has minimal fields (business name and asking price) for testing
- Uses simple inline styles to ensure visibility
- Has proper z-index to appear above other content

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/SimpleDealEditModal.tsx` - New simplified modal component
2. `/src/pages/DealDetails.tsx` - Updated to use SimpleDealEditModal

## Next Steps
If the simple modal works:
1. Gradually add more fields to match the original DealEditModal
2. Replace basic inputs with styled form components
3. Test each addition to ensure functionality remains intact

If the simple modal still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the deal data is being passed correctly
3. Check for CSS conflicts or z-index issues
4. Ensure React state updates are working properly

## Testing
1. Navigate to Deal Pipeline
2. Click on any deal to view details
3. Click "Edit Deal" button
4. Modal should appear with business name and asking price fields
5. Make changes and click Save
6. Deal should update in the database and UI
