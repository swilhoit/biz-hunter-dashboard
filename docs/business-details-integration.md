### 2. Data Completeness Scoring

### 3. AI-Powered Data Extraction

## Usage

### Adding Business Details to a Deal

1. Navigate to the Deal Detail page
2. Click on the "Business Details" tab (when integrated)
3. Click "Edit Details" to manually enter data
4. Or click "AI Auto-Fill" to extract from documents

### Using the BusinessDetailsEditor Component

```tsx
import BusinessDetailsEditor from '../components/BusinessDetailsEditor';
import { ExtendedDeal } from '../types/deal-extended';

function DealPage() {
  const [deal, setDeal] = useState<ExtendedDeal>({...});
  
  const handleUpdate = async (updates: Partial<ExtendedDeal>) => {
    await dealsAdapter.updateDeal(deal.id, updates);
    setDeal({...deal, ...updates});
  };
  
  const handleAIExtract = async (request: AIExtractionRequest) => {
    const extractor = new BusinessDataExtractor();
    const result = await extractor.extractFromDocuments(request);
    if (result.success) {
      await handleUpdate(result.extracted_fields);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <BusinessDetailsEditor 
      deal={deal}
      onUpdate={handleUpdate}
      onAIExtract={handleAIExtract}
    />
  );
}
```

### AI Analysis with Comprehensive Data

The AI analysis now checks for data completeness:

1. **Critical Data Required**:
   - Annual revenue
   - Annual profit
   - Asking price
   - Business name/category/industry

2. **Enhanced Analysis with**:
   - Website URL
   - Brand name
   - Market size
   - Competitors
   - Marketing channels
   - Customer metrics
   - Employee count

The more data available, the higher the confidence score and quality of the analysis.

## Firebase Schema

All new fields are stored directly in the deals collection in Firestore. No additional collections are needed. The fields are organized in logical groups:

```javascript
{
  // Core fields
  id, business_name, status, ...
  
  // Financial (extended)
  gross_margin, ebitda, revenue_model, ...
  
  // Business identity
  brand_name, website_url, domain_authority, ...
  
  // Digital presence
  social_media: {facebook, instagram, ...},
  online_reviews: {google, yelp, ...},
  
  // And more...
}
```

## Data Flow

1. **Manual Entry**: Users can edit fields directly in the UI
2. **Document Upload**: Files uploaded → AI extracts data → Updates deal
3. **AI Auto-Fill**: Analyzes existing deal data → Extracts missing fields
4. **Analysis**: All available data → AI generates comprehensive report

## Security

- All data is protected by Firebase security rules
- Users can only access their own deals
- Sensitive fields (EIN, financial details) are encrypted at rest

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. Add BusinessDetailsEditor to DealDetail page as a new tab
2. Create UI for bulk data import from CSV
3. Add data export functionality
4. Implement field-level change tracking
5. Add data validation rules for critical fields
