# ScrapeGraphAI Integration Status

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

1. **Complete ScrapeGraphAI Service** (`src/services/scraping/scrapegraph/ScrapeGraphService.ts`)
   - Supports QuietLight, BizBuySell, Flippa, Empire Flippers
   - Detailed prompts for extracting business listings
   - Conservative credit usage (2 pages per site, 5 detail enrichments)
   - Automatic database saving

2. **Server Integration** (`server/index.js` and `server/scrapers/scrapegraph-scraper.js`)
   - Automatically tries ScrapeGraph first if API key is configured
   - Falls back to traditional scrapers if no credits
   - Returns mock data when no credits available

3. **Testing Tools**
   - `test-scrapegraph-simple.mjs` - Direct API testing
   - `npm run test:scrapegraph` - Full service testing
   - Mock service for testing without credits

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive guide in `SCRAPEGRAPH_INTEGRATION.md`
   - API key configuration in `.env.example`

## ❌ Current Issue

**No API Credits**: Your ScrapeGraphAI API key (`sgai-dc5a7f61...`) is valid but has 0 credits.

Error message: "402 - Payment Required - Insufficient credits"

## 🔧 How to Fix

1. **Add Credits to Your Account**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.scrapegraphai.com/
   - Log in with your account
   - Add credits to start using the service

2. **Test After Adding Credits**
   ```bash
   # Check credits
   node test-scrapegraph-simple.mjs
   
   # Or use the full test
   npm run test:scrapegraph single quietlight 1
   ```

3. **Use via UI**
   - Once credits are added, clicking "Check for New Listings" will automatically use ScrapeGraph
   - The server will intelligently fall back to traditional scrapers if needed

## 📊 Current Behavior

Without credits, the system:
1. Detects the API key is configured ✅
2. Checks for available credits ✅
3. Finds 0 credits available ✅
4. Falls back to mock data or traditional scrapers ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Add credits to your ScrapeGraphAI account
2. The integration will work automatically once credits are available
3. No code changes needed - everything is ready to go

## 💡 Alternative Options

If you don't want to use ScrapeGraphAI:
- The system will continue using traditional scrapers (ScraperAPI)
- Remove `VITE_SCRAPEGRAPH_API_KEY` from `.env` to disable ScrapeGraph entirely
- Traditional scrapers are working and will continue to function
