# Finding Your Google Ads Information

## 1. Developer Token

Go to: https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter

Look for one of these:
- A box labeled "Developer token" with a long string like: `ABcdEFgh1234567890...`
- OR a button saying "APPLY FOR BASIC ACCESS"

If you see the token, copy it.
If you see the apply button:
1. Click "APPLY FOR BASIC ACCESS"
2. Fill the form:
   - API use case: "SEO/SEM tool"
   - Description: "Keyword research for Amazon FBA"
3. Submit - you'll get a test token immediately

## 2. Customer ID

In Google Ads (https://ads.google.com):
- Look at the **TOP RIGHT corner**
- You'll see something like: "Account Name (123-456-7890)"
- The numbers in parentheses are your Customer ID
- Copy it WITHOUT the dashes (e.g., 1234567890)

The Customer ID is NOT:
- Your phone number
- Your auth code
- Your refresh token

It's specifically the account identifier shown in Google Ads interface.
